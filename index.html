<h1>HELLO COME BACK TO YOUR OLD GROUP</h1>
    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <p>A lone programmer was leaving the American Legion in Ofallon, IL... with no umbrella.</p>
    <p>All that was available was a briefcase holding his laptop... The programmer sheilds himself with it as he makes his way to the car</p>
